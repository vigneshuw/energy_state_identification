# Trained model weights

## Directories

- "training_history" -> Contains the training history information as a python dictionary and is pickled
- "multi-output_KFold-*_model.h5" -> Trained weights of the multi-output model for each of the cross validation folds

## Training information

- **To determine the impact of dataset size on the model performance for the Y-axis**
- Multiple experiment runs of the Y-axis were conducted inorder to increase the number of corresponding data instances
- No oversampling was applied in this scenario
